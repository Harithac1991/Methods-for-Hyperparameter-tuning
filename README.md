# Methods-for-Hyperparameter-tuning
Grid search and random search are 2 popular method used for parameter tuning in ML and AI networks.
Grid search allows you to go through a specified set of parameters and try your luck to get into low cost region.
While Random search traverses your model to completely random sets of parameters.

If you have a clear idea on behaviour of you model on the data,i would suggest you to go for GR. 

Actual GS and RS codes are of 2 lines each, but this code set above is an implemetation of both in detail, upon a Theano based ANN network.
